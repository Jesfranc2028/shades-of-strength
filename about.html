        <p><strong>Title:</strong> <em>The Girl with the Sun-Kissed Skin</em></p>

        <p>When I was ten, a pale patch appeared on my left hand small, harmless, like a cloud had settled on my skin. I didn‚Äôt think much of it. But over the weeks, more clouds gathered. First on my hands, then my face, then my knees. I watched in silence, hoping no one would notice. But Nairobi isn‚Äôt a city where you can hide easily, especially when your skin starts to change color.</p>

        <p>At school, whispers followed me like shadows. ‚ÄúIs it contagious?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs she sick?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt have answers. Back then, vitiligo was a stranger one even I didn‚Äôt understand.</p>

        <p>My mother thought it was a rash. An aunt thought I had been cursed. A friend‚Äôs parent told her to stop playing with me. I started wearing long sleeves, even in the heat, and avoided mirrors. Some of my family didn‚Äôt know how to talk to me anymore some didn‚Äôt try. The rejection stung more than the sun.</p>

        <p>Years passed. I grew older, quieter, more withdrawn. Then one day, when I was about fifteen, I typed my symptoms into an internet caf√© computer. <strong>Vitiligo.</strong> The word felt foreign and familiar all at once. I stayed in that booth longer than I should have, reading, searching, trying to find someone who looked like me and felt like me.</p>

        <p>It took years to make peace with my reflection. Some days are still hard. But now, I wear short sleeves when I want. I walk in the sun carefully, but not fearfully. I take care of my skin and, more importantly, my spirit. I stopped looking for normal. I started looking for peace and I‚Äôm learning how to live with both.</p>

        <p>To anyone struggling with vitiligo: you are not alone. There‚Äôs a quiet community of warriors like you, learning to see the beauty in the difference, and the strength in the journey.</p>

        <p><strong>And if one day, you see a girl walking confidently through the streets of Nairobi, her skin kissed by the sun in places it no longer colors know that she‚Äôs not hiding anymore.</strong></p>

    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>
      My journey hasn‚Äôt been linear. There were days I hid from the mirror, and days I whispered affirmations to myself just to get out of bed. 
      <br><br>
      Becoming a mother added a new layer to my strength, I want my child to grow up seeing beauty not just in polished images, but in scars, in difference, in truth.
      <br><br>
      Starting *Shades of Strength* was my way of reclaiming the narrative. This isn‚Äôt just about vitiligo, it‚Äôs about resilience. It‚Äôs about softness that stands tall.

      <h2>All About Vitiligo</h2>
      <p>
        Vitiligo is a skin condition where patches of skin lose their pigment. It affects people of all skin types, though it may be more noticeable in those with darker skin. It occurs when melanocytes the cells responsible for skin pigmentation are destroyed by the immune system or stop functioning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vitiligo is not contagious or life-threatening, but it can have emotional and psychological impacts, especially when experienced at a young age or in highly visible areas. While there is no cure, treatment options include light therapy, topical steroids, and cosmetic cover-ups.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important part of living with vitiligo is embracing yourself understanding that beauty is not defined by symmetry or color, but by confidence, resilience, and authenticity.
