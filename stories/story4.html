    <h2>Sunlight follows wherever she walks.</h2>
    <p>Rozie doesn’t chase the light she carries it. Her laughter fills rooms and her kindness lingers like the scent of jasmine. With each step, she walks with grace, wearing her vitiligo like a radiant gown. She’s proof that motherhood doesn’t dim your light it multiplies it. Her little one sees her glowing and knows: mama is a sunrise in motion.</p>
