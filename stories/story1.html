    <h2>Her strength isn’t loud but it’s unshakable.</h2>
    <p>Rozie never needed to raise her voice to be heard. In quiet moments with her child, in the way she faced stares and questions, her calm was louder than any scream. Vitiligo didn't weaken her it carved her resilience into something gentle, yet firm. Her story is not one of fighting against her skin, but walking gracefully with it. She doesn’t seek pity or applause; she simply shows up each day present, loving, and unshaken. That is power in its purest form.</p>
