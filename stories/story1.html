    <h2>Her strength isn’t loud but it’s unshakable.</h2>
    <p>I never needed to raise her voice to be heard. In quiet moments with her child, in the way I faced stares and questions,calm was louder than any scream. Vitiligo didn't weaken me it carved my resilience into something gentle, yet firm. My story is not one of fighting against my skin, but walking gracefully with it. I doesn’t seek pity or applause; I simply shows up each day present, loving, and unshaken. That is power in its purest form.</p>
