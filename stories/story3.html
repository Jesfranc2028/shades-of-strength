    <h2>Softness is her superpower.</h2>
    <p>People often confuse softness for weakness. But Rozie redefines it. Her softness holds space for pain and still chooses love. She forgives even when she’s scarred, smiles even when stared at. Her skin may have changed, but her heart remains open. That’s her magic. She teaches her baby that it’s okay to feel deeply, to cry, to comfort because vulnerability is not a flaw, it’s a form of quiet bravery.</p>
