    <h2>Softness is my superpower.</h2>
    <p>People often confuse softness for weakness. But I redefine it. My softness holds space for pain and still chooses love. I forgive even when I scarred, smile even when stared at. My skin may have changed, but my heart remains open. That’s my magic. I teach my baby that it’s okay to feel deeply, to cry, to comfort because vulnerability is not a flaw, it’s a form of quiet bravery.</p>
